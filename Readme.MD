Hey! I don't know why you're reading this but if you're an employer I will warn you that there are two or three functions that are just BAD but I don't actually have time to go back and fix them! Sorry about that, it's just the sad truth of working way more hours than I should have and getting tunnel vision in terms of formatting

Case in point I return like 10 things from the mutual information function that could just as easily been wrapped somewhere else for easier management

You live and you learn

I've also left in my sanity check files which I hope endear me to you in some way

regards
